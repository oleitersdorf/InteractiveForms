            Description of Service
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            The Service requires a Google account that will be used to access the Service configuration console and a datasource which will contain the data processed by the Service. You understand and acknowledge that You are solely responsible for obtaining the Internet access and all equipment necessary to use the Service, for appropriately configuring Your Google account and for creating and managing the datasource and their content. All fees associated with the foregoing shall be paid by You.
            <br>
            <br>

            To these Terms: Interactive Forms reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service upon notice from time to time. You will be provided notice of any such modification by the publishing of such on the website. You may terminate your use of the Service if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Service.

            Customer is at all times fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions by Users to whom Customer has granted access to the Service and Customer agrees to indemnify Interactive Forms for all claims and losses related to any such acts and/or omissions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Interactive Forms reserves the right to terminate unpaid accounts. Interactive Forms will provide Customer with prior notice of such termination by email.

            Interactive Forms reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s access to the Service with or without notice if Interactive Forms reasonably determines that:
            <br>
            <br>
            (a) there is a threat or attack on the Service (including a denial of service attack) or other event that may create a risk to the Service, Interactive Forms, Customer, or any user of the Service;
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            Intellectual Property
            <br>
            <br>
            Customer hereby acknowledges and agrees that, subject to the limited rights granted hereunder, Interactive Forms (or its licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, any Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights which exist in the Service (whether such rights are registered or unregistered, and wherever in the world those rights may exist) (“Our Technology”). For purposes of these Terms, “Intellectual Property Rights” means, on a worldwide basis, any and all now known or hereafter known (a) rights associated with works of authorship including copyrights and moral rights, (b) trademark and trade name rights and similar rights, (c) trade secret rights, (d) patent rights and other industrial property rights, (e) intellectual and industrial property rights of every other kind and nature and however designated, whether arising by operation of law or otherwise, and (f) all registrations, applications, renewals, extensions, continuations, divisions, or reissues thereof now or hereafter existing, made, or in force (including any rights in any of the foregoing).
            <br>
            <br>
            Our Technology may not be copied, modified, reproduced, republished, posted, transmitted, sold, offered for sale, or redistributed in any way without our prior written permission and the prior written permission of our applicable licensors. You must abide by all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in or attached to any of Our Technology. Nothing in these Terms of Use grants you any right to receive delivery of a copy of Our Technology or to obtain access to Our Technology except as generally and ordinarily permitted through the Service according to these Terms. Furthermore, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to grant, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, a license to Our Technology. Certain of the names, logos, and other materials displayed on the Service constitute trademarks, trade names, service marks or logos (“Marks”) of Interactive Forms or other entities. You are not authorized to use any such Marks. Ownership of all such Marks and the goodwill associated therewith remains with and will inure to us or those other entities. To the extent indicated, any use of third party software provided in connection with the Service will be governed by such third parties’ licenses and not by these Terms of Service. Furthermore, any comments, ideas and/or reports about the Service that you provide to us, whether in written or electronic form (“Feedback”), shall be considered our proprietary and confidential information, and you hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to us all intellectual property rights embodied in or arising in connection with such Feedback, and any other rights or claims that you may have with respect to any such Feedback.
            <br>
            <br>
            Ownership and Privacy
            <br>
            <br>
            As between You and Interactive Forms, you retain all right, title and interest in any and all data, files, attachments, text, images, personally identifiable information, and other content that You and Your Users upload or submit to the Service (collectively, "Your Content"). You may not upload, post or otherwise make available through the Service any material protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of such copyright, trademark or other proprietary right owned by a third party, and the burden of determining whether any material is protected by any such right is on you. You shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use any and all of Your Content. You represent and warrant that you have all rights, permissions and consents necessary (a) to make Your Content available on or through the Service, and (b) to grant Interactive Forms the limited rights to use Your Content set forth in these Terms.
            <br>
            <br>
            You agree that Interactive Forms may use Your Content to provide the Service and its features, including by making it available for viewing, download and modification by other Users with access rights to Your Content. You hereby grant Interactive Forms a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to access, use, reproduce, distribute, store, transmit, publicly display, and publicly perform Your Content as required for the purpose of providing the Service to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            You understand and agree that Interactive Forms may, notwithstanding any provision of any separate nondisclosure agreement that may have been executed between You and Interactive Forms, distribute and disclose Your Content (a) to your Users, and (b) to Interactive Forms' service providers who act on Interactive Forms' behalf in providing the Service. Interactive Forms' use of any personally identifiable information you provide through the Service is governed by our Privacy Policy. Your use of the Service indicates your acceptance of the terms of our Privacy Policy. You can review the most recent version of our Privacy Policy at :
            <br>
            <br>
            https://interactiveforms.oleitersdorf.com/privacy-policy/
            <br>
            <br>
            You hereby consent that, if You choose to become a paying customer of the Service, Interactive Forms may identify You as a Interactive Forms customer (using Your name and logo) and generally describe the products or services it provides to You in its promotional materials, presentations, and proposals to other current and prospective customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Confidentiality and Data security
            <br>
            <br>
            While Interactive Form requests permission to access the full contents of users’ Drive folders, this is because the Apps Script development framework offers us no workable alternative of more limited scope. These access rights are required to allow actions performed by the end user, and in no case are the textual contents of users’ files transmitted to any 3rd party services outside of the user’s direct control or knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            All personally identifiable data that users may keep in files associated with this tool remains in the complete control of those users from a privacy perspective. Unless specifically stated, we store no personally identifiable information in any 3rd party database or file repository.
            <br>
            <br>
            Warranty Disclaimer
            <br>
            <br>
            THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. INTERACTIVE FORMS MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INTERRUPTIONS THAT OCCUR IN THE CONTEXT OF REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE); (III) ANY INFORMATION OR ADVICE OBTAINED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE; OR (IV) THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO CUSTOMER.
            <br>
            <br>
            Limitation of Liability
            <br>
            <br>
            IN NO EVENT SHALL INTERACTIVE FORMS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER FAILURE, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION), ARISING OUT OF OR CAUSED BY YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, EVEN IF INTERACTIVE FORMS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH INTERACTIVE FORMS RELATED TO ANY OF THE SERVICE SHALL BE TERMINATION OF SUCH SERVICE.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other Terms
            <br>
            <br>
            These Terms, their interpretation, performance or any breach thereof, will be construed in accordance with, and all questions with respect thereto will be determined by, the laws of the State of Luxembourg. Both parties hereby irrevocably submit any disputes under these Terms to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of Luxembourg.
